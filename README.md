# Face + Emotion Recognition System

Our project combines face recognition with emotion analysis to build an intelligent system that can monitor user emotions in real-time. This system has potential applications in:

1- Mental health monitoring

2- Virtual classrooms to track student engagement

3-Smart kiosks for personalized experiences

By detecting both identity and emotional state, the system aims to enhance human-computer interaction and provide meaningful insights through facial expressions.
